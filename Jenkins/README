if you install the jenkins successfully and login to it and after that you get error "ubable to connect to jenkins", then do the following.

1. Add Jenkins user to root group: sudo usermod -a -G root jenkins
2. Make Jenkins listen to all external IPs by editing file /etc/default/jenkins and add/changing the JENKINS_LISTEN_ADDRESS="0.0.0.0"

Once this is done, restart the jenkins server and then try to install plugins for jenkins.
