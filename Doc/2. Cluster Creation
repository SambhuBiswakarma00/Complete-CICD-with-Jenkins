# Cluster creation with Kubeadm

- Install the kubeadm. You can find the installtion command in Terraform/Installs/kube_and_java_install.sh
- Once the installation is complete, we need to initialize the Control-Plane node of the cluster using "kubeadm init" command.
- You need to follow the instructions provided on the terminal after the control-plane is initialized successfully.
- To make kubectl work for your non-root user, run these commands, which are also part of the kubeadm init output:
  ```
  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
  ```
